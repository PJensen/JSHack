# Shopkeeper Aggro and Shop Law Design

This note captures the intended direction for shopkeeper aggro when shop
interactions go bad. The goal is not a simple "player steals, shopkeeper turns
hostile" switch. The goal is a rich shop-law system that lets players attempt
exploits, feel clever for a moment, and then discover that the simulation kept
the receipt.

## Design Goals

- Expensive shop stock should tempt the player. Killer items and rare gems are
  more interesting when most are out of reach.
- Theft should be possible, risky, and sometimes temporarily successful.
- The game should detect value extraction by behavior, not by hardcoded item or
  spell cases.
- Shopkeepers should have memory, evidence, debt claims, and escalating
  responses.
- Clever exploits should create better stories, not bypass the economy.

Example target moments:

- The player throws an expensive gem out of the shop, walks out later, and the
  shopkeeper already knows what happened.
- The player drinks a potion and teleports outside, only to trigger a debt claim
  and shop alarm.
- The player picks up unpaid stock, blinks outside, and learns that teleporting
  avoided the door guard but not the ledger.

## Current Foundation

The codebase already has a strong first layer:

- `src/rules/components/Unpaid.js` marks shop-owned stock.
- `src/rules/components/ShopDebt.js` records extracted value attached under the
  debtor actor.
- `src/rules/utils/shopDebt.js` provides the debt ledger and virtual view.
- `src/rules/utils/shopEnforcement.js` evaluates bills, credit, containment,
  and refusal.
- `src/rules/systems/shopkeeperSystem.js` blocks ordinary movement out of a
  shop while the player carries unpaid goods or unpaid extracted-value debt.

The main gap is that current enforcement is mostly door/exit based. It catches
normal walking out. It should also catch value leaving shop control through
throwing, consumption, teleportation, destruction, laundering, and delayed
recovery.

## Core Model

Keep `Unpaid` as the canonical ownership marker for shop stock. Keep `ShopDebt`
as the canonical bill. Add a richer incident/memory record for how the crime was
discovered and how the world should respond.

Proposed new child-entity component:

```js
export const ShopIncident = defineComponent("ShopIncident", {
  shopkeeperId: 0,
  actorId: 0,
  itemId: 0,
  amount: 0,
  reason: "carried_out",
  evidence: "ledger",
  severity: 0,
  createdTurn: 0,
  resolved: false,
});
```

`ShopDebt` answers: what does the actor owe?

`ShopIncident` answers: what does the shopkeeper know, remember, and do about
it?

Suggested `reason` values:

- `carried_out`
- `thrown_out`
- `consumed`
- `teleport_exit`
- `destroyed`
- `laundered`
- `knowledge_theft`

Suggested `evidence` values:

- `seen`
- `heard`
- `ledger`
- `arcane_mark`
- `witness`
- `circumstantial`

## Canonical Shop-Law Path

All shop crimes should route through one canonical rules helper, not scattered
special cases:

```txt
shop-owned item or value changes state
  -> classify incident
  -> record debt if value was extracted
  -> record incident/evidence
  -> evaluate response tier
  -> emit shop-law events
```

Proposed helper module:

- `src/rules/utils/shopLaw.js`

Likely helpers:

- `findShopAt(world, x, y)`
- `findOwnerShop(world, shopkeeperId)`
- `isInsideShopRoom(world, x, y, shopkeeperId)`
- `recordShopIncident(world, spec)`
- `recordUnpaidExtraction(world, spec)`
- `evaluateShopLawResponse(world, spec)`

The helper should use deterministic data only. No DOM, no timers, no async, no
display imports.

## Event Hooks

Install a Symbol-guarded listener bundle from `configureWorld()`:

```js
const INSTALLED = Symbol.for("jshack:shopLaw:listeners:installed");

export function installShopLawListeners(world) {
  if (world[INSTALLED]) return;
  world[INSTALLED] = true;

  world.on("item:thrown", onItemThrown);
  world.on("item:dropped", onItemDropped);
  world.on("item:pickup", onItemPickup);
  world.on("moved", onMoved);
  world.on("shop:unauthorized-use", onUnauthorizedUse);
}
```

Do not call systems directly. Listeners should record facts and emit events.
AI/system response should remain phase controlled.

## Trigger Semantics

### Pickup

Picking up unpaid stock inside its owner shop is not theft by itself. It is
handling merchandise.

Possible response:

- Cheap item: no response.
- Expensive item: shopkeeper warning.
- Repeated handling: suspicion increases.

No aggro should happen on pickup alone unless the player is already under an
active claim.

### Drop

Dropping unpaid stock inside its owner shop is fine.

Dropping unpaid stock outside the owner shop records extracted value or an
incident, depending on whether the item remains recoverable.

Questions to settle during implementation:

- If the item lands just outside the door, does the shopkeeper demand payment or
  retrieve it?
- If the item lands in a dangerous/hazardous tile, does that count as
  destruction?

### Throw

Throwing is the first high-value exploit case.

Rules:

- If an unpaid item is thrown from inside its owner shop to outside that shop,
  record `ShopDebt` and `ShopIncident(reason: "thrown_out")`.
- If the thrown item is destroyed or consumed by its throw payload, record the
  full value immediately.
- If a stack throw creates a fresh item copy, the copy must preserve shop claim
  state or the thrown unit must immediately become debt.
- The throw event should include enough `from` and `to` data for shop-law
  classification.

This avoids parity drift between whole-entity throws, stack throws, and special
throw payloads.

### Consumption and Use

Unpaid value consumed by the player should become debt even if the item entity is
destroyed.

Existing spellbook knowledge theft already points in the right direction:
consuming the unpaid book records debt even when the book is gone. Generalize
that behavior for potions, scrolls, wands, and other use/apply/drink flows.

Consumption should classify the reason:

- Potion: `consumed`
- Scroll/spellbook knowledge: `knowledge_theft`
- Wand charge: possibly `charge_theft`
- Item transformation: `laundered` or `altered_stock`

### Teleport and Forced Movement

Ordinary exits can be blocked before `movementSystem`. Teleports are different:
they may change `Position` before shop enforcement can block the move.

Use the canonical `moved` event:

- If `from` is inside a shop and `to` is outside the same shop,
- and the actor carries unpaid stock or has unpaid extracted-value debt,
- then record `ShopIncident(reason: "teleport_exit")`.

Because the actor has already moved, the response should not pretend the exit
was blocked. It should escalate to pursuit, lockdown, alarm, or delayed debt
collection.

Spells and potion effects may emit richer source events such as `spell:blink`,
but shop law should key primarily off movement and unpaid value. Spell-specific
branches should be flavor only.

## Response Tiers

Shopkeeper aggro should be tiered, not binary.

### Tier 0: Notice

The shopkeeper notices suspicious handling.

Examples:

- "Careful with that."
- "That ruby is worth more than your boots."

Used for expensive pickup, repeated handling, and suspicious positioning.

### Tier 1: Challenge

The shopkeeper asserts a claim.

Examples:

- Exit blocked.
- Checkout opened.
- Player is told the exact bill.

This maps to existing `shop:claim-enforced` and `shop:exit-blocked` behavior.

### Tier 2: Containment

The shop locks down.

Examples:

- Doors close and lock.
- Shopkeeper moves toward the exit.
- Bell/alarm event fires.
- Nearby townfolk react.

Reuse existing townfolk door and bell mechanisms where possible.

### Tier 3: Pursuit

The shopkeeper actively hunts the player.

Implementation should use `AggroState` or existing AI intent pathways, not
direct system calls. The shopkeeper should know a last-seen or last-known
position, with evidence severity affecting persistence.

### Tier 4: Town Alarm

The theft becomes social knowledge.

Examples:

- Other shops refuse service.
- Other shops increase markup.
- Townfolk avoid or report the player.
- Guards or bounty hunters become possible.

This should be separate from the individual shop bill. Debt is economic. Alarm
is reputation/legal state.

### Tier 5: Delayed Consequence

This is the most important fantasy for "the game knew."

Examples:

- The player returns later and the shopkeeper says, "You still owe me for the
  emerald."
- A merchant recognizes a supposedly stolen gem.
- A debt collector confronts the player after several turns.
- A magically marked item cannot be sold cleanly.
- A different shop refuses service because word traveled.

Delayed consequence lets theft feel successful before the simulation closes the
loop.

## Example Flows

### Throwing an Expensive Gem

1. Gem has `Unpaid { shopkeeperId, price }`.
2. Player throws it.
3. `item:thrown` includes `from` inside the shop and `to` outside the shop.
4. Shop law records debt for `price`.
5. Shop law records incident:

```js
{
  reason: "thrown_out",
  evidence: "seen", // or "ledger" if not directly visible
  severity: high,
}
```

6. If the player remains inside, the shopkeeper blocks exit and demands payment.
7. If the player escapes, pursuit or delayed debt collection begins.

### Drinking an Unpaid Teleport Potion

1. Potion has `Unpaid`.
2. Drink pipeline consumes the potion.
3. Shop law records debt with `reason: "consumed"`.
4. Potion effect teleports actor outside.
5. `moved` listener sees inside-to-outside displacement.
6. Shop law records `reason: "teleport_exit"`.
7. Response escalates because the player both consumed stock and escaped.

### Picking Up Stock Then Blinking Out

1. Player picks up unpaid item inside shop.
2. No theft yet; maybe warning if high value.
3. Player casts blink or uses a teleport item.
4. `moved` listener catches shop exit with unpaid goods.
5. Existing debt/bill evaluator can calculate carried unpaid goods.
6. Since exit cannot be blocked retroactively, emit alarm/pursuit instead.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `ShopIncident` component and export it from component index.
2. Add `src/rules/utils/shopLaw.js` with canonical classification and recording
   helpers.
3. Add `installShopLawListeners(world)` and call it once from
   `src/main/scheduler.js`.
4. Add tests for:
   - throwing unpaid item outside records debt
   - thrown stack preserves or converts unpaid claim
   - unpaid consumed potion records debt
   - teleport out with unpaid item records incident
   - walking exit behavior remains unchanged
5. Add response events only after the ledger is correct:
   - `shop:incident-recorded`
   - `shop:theft-escaped`
   - `shop:alarm`
   - `shop:pursuit-requested`
6. Wire AI/reputation behavior through existing ECS events and phase systems.

## Design Constraints

- Rules layer only. No display imports.
- All randomness through `world.rand()`.
- No async, timers, promises, or fetch in rules.
- No system-to-system calls.
- Preserve one canonical path for recording extracted shop value.
- Do not duplicate material/gem value data into display.
- World coordinates may be negative; do not clamp.
- Stack handling must preserve ownership/debt semantics.

## Open Questions

- Should a recoverable thrown item outside the shop immediately become debt, or
  only become debt when the player exits or another actor retrieves it?
- Should shopkeepers have magical ledgers by default, or should evidence quality
  depend on shop type and item value?
- How should honest mistakes be forgiven? For example, picking up an item and
  returning it immediately.
- Should high-value gems carry intrinsic shop marks that other merchants can
  recognize?
- How long should delayed debt collection wait before escalating into town
  reputation?

## Guiding Principle

The shopkeeper does not need to physically see every exploit. The shop has a
ledger, ownership marks, witnesses, memory, and social reach. Players should be
able to steal. They should even be able to escape for a while. But the value
trail should remain part of the world.
