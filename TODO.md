# Project TODO

This TODO file contains prioritized tasks for the project. Keep items small and actionable.

## Current priorities

- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add a short README section explaining how to open and test the app in a browser
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for core actions
- [ ] Add responsive design improvements
- [ ] Add mobile support

## Engine priorities

- [ ] Sound (add background music and effects, volume controls)
- [ ] More spells (expand spell list, balance mechanics)
- [ ] More monsters (add new enemy types, behaviors, and loot)

## Gameplay priorities

- [ ] Leveling mechanics (stat increases, skill unlocks)
- [ ] Merchants (buy/sell items, basic inventory and price system. Acceptance: merchant UI to trade and inventory persistence between sessions)
- [ ] Local Save and Restore (use localStorage to save player state and restore on load. Acceptance: save/load buttons and automatic restore on launch)

## Low priority / future

- [ ] Add CI (GitHub Actions) with a simple lint

## Notes

- The project currently uses a single HTML file: `js-hack.html`. Edit that file directly for small changes.
- To test locally, open `js-hack.html` in a browser (no server required).
